			<h2>Our scientists research the efficacy of Lumosity</h2>
			<h5>We conducted a randomized study on Lumosity, using crossword puzzles as an active control.</h5>

				<section>
					<h4>What we did</h4>
					<p>Our scientists had 4,715 participants complete the study. Half trained with Lumosity, while the rest did online crossword puzzles to control for placebo effects.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>What we found</h4>
					<p>After 10 weeks, the Lumosity group improved more than the crosswords group on an aggregate assessment of cognition.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Next questions</h4>
					<p>These results are promising, but we need to do more research to determine the connection between improved assessment scores and everyday tasks in participants’ lives. That’s our next focus.</p>
